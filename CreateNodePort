Create a NodePort service on top of your nginx pods:

cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
EOF

Get a list of services in the cluster.
kubectl get svc

You should see your service called nginx-service.

Since this is a NodePort service, you should be able to access it using port 30080 on any of your cluster's servers. You can test this with the command:
curl localhost:30080

You should get an HTML response from nginx!
