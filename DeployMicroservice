Clone the Git repo that contains the pre-made descriptors:

cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/robot-shop.git

Since this application has many components, it is a good idea to create a separate namespace for the app:
kubectl create namespace robot-shop

Deploy the app to the cluster:
kubectl -n robot-shop create -f ~/robot-shop/K8s/descriptors/

Check the status of the application's pods:
kubectl get pods -n robot-shop

You should be able to reach the robot shop app from your 
browser using the Kube master node's public IP: http://$kube_master_public_ip:30080

////////////

Scale up the MongoDB deployment to two replicas instead of just one.

Edit the deployment descriptor:
kubectl edit deployment mongodb -n robot-shop
You should see some YAML describing the deployment object.

Under spec:, look for the line that says replicas: 1 and change it to replicas: 2.
Save and exit.
Check the status of the deployment with:

kubectl get deployment mongodb -n robot-shop
After a few moments, the number of available replicas should be 2.
