Clone the Git repository:

cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/robot-shop.git

Create a namespace and deploy the application objects to the namespace using the deployment descriptors from the Git repository:

kubectl create namespace robot-shop

kubectl -n robot-shop create -f ~/robot-shop/K8s/descriptors/

Get a list of the application's pods and wait for all of them to finish starting up:

kubectl get pods -n robot-shop -w

Once all the pods are up, you can access the application in a browser using the public IP of one of your Kubernetes servers and port 30080:
http://$kube_server_public_ip:30080
