cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx

  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
EOF

Get a list of pods and verify that your new nginx pod is in the Running state:

kubectl get pods

Get more information about your nginx pod:

Delete the pod:
kubectl delete pod nginx
