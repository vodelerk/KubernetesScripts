On the Kube master node, initialize the cluster:

sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16

That command may take a few minutes to complete.

When it is done, set up the local kubeconfig:

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Verify that the cluster is responsive and that Kubectl is working:

kubectl version

You should get Server Version as well as Client Version. It should look something like this:

Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"12", GitVersion:"v1.12.2", GitCommit:"17c77c7898218073f14c8d573582e8d2313dc740", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-10-24T06:54:59Z", GoVersion:"go1.10.4", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"12", GitVersion:"v1.12.2", GitCommit:"17c77c7898218073f14c8d573582e8d2313dc740", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-10-24T06:43:59Z", GoVersion:"go1.10.4", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

The kubeadm init command should output a kubeadm join command containing a token and hash. 

Copy that command and run it with sudo on both worker nodes. It should look something like this:

sudo kubeadm join $some_ip:6443 --token $some_token --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash $some_hash

Verify that all nodes have successfully joined the cluster:

kubectl get nodes

You should see all three of your nodes listed. It should look something like this:

NAME                      STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION
wboyd1c.mylabserver.com   NotReady   master   5m17s   v1.12.2
wboyd2c.mylabserver.com   NotReady   <none>   53s     v1.12.2
wboyd3c.mylabserver.com   NotReady   <none>   31s     v1.12.2

Note: The nodes are expected to have a STATUS of NotReady at this point.
